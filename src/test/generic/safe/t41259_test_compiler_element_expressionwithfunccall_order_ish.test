## ish, informed by Dave 3/14/18 generated SPLAT code; Sorry, grammar says rhs of +/- is a term. Term leads to Factor.
## Factor allows assign_expression within parens. The extra parens around the f, (f).func(), ends the assign_expression.
## Without the extra parens, f.func() is fine as rhs (t41260).
## Changing the grammar screws up the precedence for other tests:
## parseExpression instead of parseTerm for rhs, breaks: t3305,8 t3418, t3430, t3510,13,19, t3578,9, t3985, t41077, t41084.
## Or trying for more after the closing paren, breaks: t3200, t3201,2,3,7,8, t3246, t3876, t3877, t41140
