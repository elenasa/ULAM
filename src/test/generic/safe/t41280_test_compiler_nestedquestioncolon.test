## ISH informed by Dave splat QMembrane code 2/24/19.
##
## The parens around the first ?: expr triggered an eval stack assertion
## during constant-folding of the return statement; the ?: as a condition
## was not a constant, even though its right/left nodes were (THE BUG!);
## the max depth had yet to be calculated, so the stack was still zero,
## and t.f. unevalable;
## Without the parens, the first term was a binary op, which requires
## both terms to be constant to be considered for constant-folding.
